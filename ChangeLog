ODBC binding for Ruby
---------------------
Mon Aug 21 2023 version 0.102.cv release <grajwade@vmware.com>
	* Syntax changes to support Ruby 3.2 by using native "rb_str_new" instead of "rb_tainted_str_new"
          Remove tained usage (thanks @vhermecz)
	  Fix error 'tried to create Proc object without a block (ArgumentError)'

Tue Feb 12 2019 version 0.101.cv release <slawson@vmware.com>
	* Minor syntax changes to support Ruby 2.4
	  Don't pass "" as the second parameter to has_library()
	  Ensure char* are passed to rb_scan_args()

Wed August 31 2016 version 0.100.cv release <slawson@vmware.com>
	* Add support for Ruby 2.x by using native "rb_thread_call_without_gvl" directly (thanks @shreyasahir)

Wed April 12 2014 version 0.99 release <matt@cloudvolumes.com>
	* Remove debug log

Wed April 8 2014 version 0.98 release <matt@cloudvolumes.com>
	* Set login time to 30 seconds

Wed Feb 26 2014 version 0.97 release <steve@cloudvolumes.com>
	* Force encoding of all ruby strings in results to UTF8 if Encoding.default_external == 'UTF-8'
	  You must be saving and retrieving UTF8 compatible strings in the database.

Wed Jan 16 2014 version 0.99996 released

	* Added call to rb_thread_blocking_region to release the global
	  interpreter lock during SQLExecute and SQLExecDirect and require it
	  afterwards.

	  This improves performance by not blocking all Ruby threads during long
	  running queries. This also fixes a deadlock which can occur in SQLExecute and
	  SQLExecDirect which can happen when trying to read (if isolation level is
	  "read committed", "repeatable read", "serializable", etc.) or when trying to
	  modify a dirty row that has been modified by an uncommitted transaction. If this
	  transaction was initiated by a ruby thread in the same process, all ruby threads
	  will hang and the ruby process will become unresponsive.

Wed Mar 13 2013 version 0.99995 released

	* added ODBC::Database.use_sql_column_name= flag to switch
	  usage of SQLColAttributes(SQL_COLUMN_LABEL) to
